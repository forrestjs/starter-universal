/**
 * App Reducer
 * -----------
 *
 * Every project has some kind of super generic setting that may
 * change over time but in the end they don't.
 *
 * Put all those settings in here and propagate them to your components
 * via Redux's `connect`.
 *
 * This is a safe way to handle it because of the `Open-Closed Principle`
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle
 *
 * 1. The server can provide those informations via `initialState`
 * 2. You can implement actions and service so to re-fetch and mutate them
 * 3. It's just a good place to put those stuff :-)
 *
 * Trust me, I fucked this up so many times that I know by direct experience
 * that this is the less-fucked-up way to handle your app's generic informations.
 *
 * NOTE:
 * To learn more about the structure of this file refer to the documentation:
 * https://marcopeg.com/react-ssr/articles/reducers.html
