#
# Environment Variables
# ---------------------
#
# This is the simplest way to pass configuration to your app.
#
# The classic example is a database connection string where you use
# the "root/root" credentials in your local development machine, but then
# you may want to set some strong credentials in production.
#
# NOTE:
# This configuration gets read by your SERVER and your WEBPACK build script.
# But in the client (built by Webpack and based on CRA) only the variables
# that start by "REACT_APP_" will be available!
#
# LOCAL ENVIRONMENT:
# ------------------
# I usually put all my default settings in `.env` and commit it to my Git repository.
# This file should contain only default or development settings, no sensitive data.
#
# Then I create a `.env.local` and write there any variable that I don't want to
# commit. This file is .gitignored and is perfect to contain secrets.
#
# The idea is that the app should be able to correctly boot right after a `git clone``
# using all the variables provided in `.env`. But if I want to change anything to
# adapt to my local environment (or to production) I use `.env.local`.
#
# Simple. Right?
