# forrest-starter-universal

Before you start reading, take a look at the running app that you get by
cloning this repository:

[Live example on Heroku](https://forrest-starter-universal.herokuapp.com/)

## Quick Start

You can kick off your custom project based on this boilerplate using
the [Forrest CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forrest):

    npx forrest run project-name

then open:

    http://localhost:8080

## What do I get?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [ForrestJS](https://forrestjs.github.io).

You can quickly start to build a **universal web app** with:

- Configure your Webpack without ejecting thanks to [react-scripts-rewired](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts-rewired)
- [redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux) state manager
- Component based routing thanks to [react-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)
- Code splitting thanks to [react-loadable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-loadable)
- Multilanguage support thanks to [react-intl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-intl)
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) backend with a bounch of built in functionalities
- [Node Hooks](https://marcopeg.github.io/hooks/) for a modular backend codebase
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) based API
- Conditional caching for all your routes
- Dockerfile ready to **deploy your full application in a container**

Your app will load in the client and in the server, you have a good deal of
control about that.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Builds and starts both API and CRA app in a single command.

- http://localhost:3000 serves the Webpack Dev Server as provided by CRA
- http://localhost:8080 serves the SSR app
- http://localhost:8080/api serves the GraphQL development interface

### `npm run start:prod`

Builds and run the full app for production.

1. Your client (`/src`) is bundled by CRA
2. Your client (`/src`) is transpiled for SSR
3. Your server (`/ssr`) is transpiled for SSR
4. Localized strings are estracted from your app's source



### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run lint`

Runs the `eslint` check in your terminal.<br>
Useful to integrate with CI tools.

ESLint should also work just fine with your IDE. I use VSCode and I'm happy.

### `npm run styleguide`

Runs the [react-styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org) examples in a
frontend project that does not require the entire app running.

Take a look at `./styleguide.config.js` to learn how to add components to it and
how to hack it so to match your app's needs.
