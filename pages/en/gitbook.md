# Document with Gitbook

[Gitbook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitbook-cli) is a great documentation tool.  
It takes _Markdown_ files and generates a static website out of them.

In this example we are using the very same pages that compose the main website, and
we package them with Gitbook so to create a `/docs` folder that is then used
by GitHub as origin for the public website of the repository.
