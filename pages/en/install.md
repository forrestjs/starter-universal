# Install from NPM

The easiest way to start a project based on _Forrest Starter Universal_ is to
install it with _NPX_:

    npx forrest run my-project

You can also install _ForrestJS_ globally:

    npm install -g forrest

and then run the command:

    forrest run my-project

This will generate a brand new project in `./my-project`, cloning what you see in 
[this website](https://forrest-starter-universal.herokuapp.com/).

In few minutes you will have the **production build** running on
http://localhost:8080

If you want to **change port** you can run:

    npx forrest run my-project -p 7000
