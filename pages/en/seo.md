# Search Engine Optimization

The **pages** feature uses the informations that are written in the documents'
_frontmatter_ and populates the relevant meta tags using
[react-helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-helmet).

Helmet works wonders in the SSR too, so your website will score high on the
search engine results.
