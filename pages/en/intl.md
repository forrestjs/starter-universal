# Internationalization

This start has built in support for [react-intl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-intl)
which offers a simple interface to string translations.

This website is an example that implements:

- contents separated by language sub-path: `/en`, `/it`
- infrastructural string translated via _react-intl_

Many apps will offer a translatable UI, but the contents will be produced by their
community, so there is not so much control over it :-)
