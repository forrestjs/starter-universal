 * and import into your application's context.
 *
 * Take a look at the `.env` file where I wrote some basic configuration that
 * many modules are able to read, and feel free to extend the `settings` object
 * with custom informations.
 *
 * Any new hook that you may need to register will receive those settings.

 * capabilities that you generally need across very different applications,
 * like an Express app or a GraphQL endpoint.
 *
 * FEATURES are **business aware** modules that make sense only for this specific
 * application. Usually you write your data store models, routes or GraphQL
 * queries in a feature implementing one or more hooks.
